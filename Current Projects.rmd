I systematically study the key population dynamic processes underling grassland restoration, which provide the in-depth ecological understanding essential for the sustainable management of grasslands. My lab has  established several permanent research platforms to conduct long-term ecological researches under climate change in the cold and dry regions in China, including 1) long-term warming and precipitation controlling experimental system on Tibetan Plateau to examine the responses of dominant alpine plant species to climate warming and precipitation changing; 2) long-term study plots to monitor the population dynamics of dominant alpine plants along elevation gradients on Tibetan Plateau; 3) long-term precipitation platforms to study how plants in desertified sandland respond to changes in precipitation; 4）long-term nitrogen addition experiments on Tibetan Plateau and Inner-Mongolia grasslands. These research platforms provide an excellent opportunity for international collaborative projects.

These research platforms also provide an excellent opportunity for international collaborative projects.
