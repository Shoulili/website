## Professor in Ecology and Biodiversity, Lanzhou University

I am a quantitative ecologist. I integrate empirical data and theory with mathematical and computational models to predict the responses of plant populations to environmental changes, as well as to provide support for decision-making in ecological restoration, biodiversity conservation, invasive species management and optimal control of infectious disease.
