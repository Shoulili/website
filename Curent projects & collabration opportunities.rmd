I systematically study the key population dynamic processes underling grassland restoration, which provide the in-depth ecological understanding essential for the sustainable management of grasslands. My lab has has established several permanent research platforms to conduct long-term ecological researches under climate change in the cold and dry regions in China, including 1) long-term warming and precipitation controlling experimental system on Tibetan Plateau to examine the responses of  alpine plants from different functional groups to climate warming and precipitation changing; 2) Permanent research plots to monitor the population dynamics of dominant alpine plants along elevation gradients on Tibetan Plateau;3)long-term demographic studies to examine the effects different grazing regimes on the sustainable development of grasslands on Tibetan Plateau; 4) long-term research platforms to study how plants in desertified sandland respond to changes in seasonal precipitation and warming; 5）long-term experiments on Tibetan Plateau and Inner-Mongolia to examine the effects of nutrient addition on grasslands in alpine and arid regions. These research platforms also provide an excellent opportunity for international collaborative projects.

## **Climate change**

Long-term seasonal warming experiments at two sites (3200m a.b.s and 4750m a.b.s) on Tibetan Plateau to examine the responses of dominant alpine plants to climate warming.
