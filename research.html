<p>I am a quantitative ecologist. I integrate empirical data and theory
with mathematical and computational models to predict the responses of
plant populations to environmental changes, as well as to provide
support for decision-making in ecological restoration, biodiversity
conservation, invasive species management and optimal control of
infectious disease.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="life-history-traits-and-population-dynamics"
class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Life history traits and population dynamics</strong></h1>
<p><img src="photos/desert.jpg"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>I studied the demography of dominant shrubs in the drylands of Inner
Mongolia using a combination of empirical and theoretical approaches. I
investigated how woody plants manage to colonize mobile sand dunes, to
maintain populations across different dune fixation stages, and to cope
with grazing activities of large herbivores. It showed that the studied
shrub species could adopt different life history strategies toward under
different dune fixation processconditions. Populations realized rapid
expansion with high recruitment and fast plant growth at the early
mobile dune stage. As the dunes got became more fixed, population growth
started to decline, and large plants frequently exhibited shrinkage in
size but maintained , which was in a way to keep survival, a main
contributor to population maintenance at later dune fixation stages.
This study suggested that a slight disturbance by herbivores would help
to keep the shrub populations to growgrowing, and the local management
policy of completely fencing off the populations without any
disturbance, which had been applied for decades in the study area, was
not necessary and not recommended (Li et al. 2011, Journal of
Ecology).</p>
<p><img src="photos/dune.jpg"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>I also evaluated the effects of seasonal grazing on the population
performance of a dominant leguminous shrub, which was a dominant species
and served as the main forage in the study area in Inner Mongolia, by
comparative demographic studies in seasonally grazed and ungrazed areas.
It showed that the population growth was mainly maintained by high adult
survival, which was hardly affected by seasonal grazing. Although seed
reproduction and seedling establishment were significantly reduced by
seasonal grazing, they did not affect the overall population growth, as
population growth was not sensitive to changes in fecundity. Therefore,
this study suggested that seasonal grazing was a sustainable grazing
regime, and the complete cessation of grazing regime, which was
economically undesired and had been applied to almost 20 million
hectares in the study areas, was not necessary (Li et al. 2013, Journal
of Applied Ecology).</p>

<div
id="demographic-strategies-of-invasive-species-in-temporally-varying-environments"
class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Demographic strategies of invasive species in temporally
varying environments</strong></h1>
<p>To continue to explore life history strategies in temporarily varying
environments and to understand what make invasive species so successful,
I did a meta-analysis of demographic responses of invasive plants to
temporal environmental changes. Through my study, I found that
conclusions about demographic strategies were affected by the life form
as it interacted with the modelling method. My findings emphasize the
role of life form and methodological issues that need to be considered
when exploring demographic strategies in fluctuating environments (Li et
al. 2015, Population Ecology).</p>
<p><img src="photos/buffer.jpg"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, I integrated demographic modeling and genetic analysis
to quantitatively evaluate the effects of genetic diversity on long-term
population growth and on populations’ ability to buffer temporal
environmental variations. I found that high 1 genetic diversity only
facilitated early seedling recruitment, but not the fitness of later
life stages, the long-term population growth rate, or the ability to
adapt to environmental variations. My study therefore explained to some
extent the paradox of successful invasion events with low genetic
variation (Li et al. 2015, Annals of Botany).</p>
<p><img src="photos/ssr.jpg"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>We demonstrate an approach of using Value of Information (VoI)
framework to simultaneously analyse the effects of biological and
operational uncertainties on invasion control. We applied this framework
to a case study: minimizing the long‐term population growth of musk
thistle , * Carduus nutans *, a invasive plant native in France and
invading USA, Austrailia and New Zealand, using several insects as
biological control agents. We found that intervention rank is determined
both by biological processes in the targeted invasive populations and by
intervention effectiveness. Ignoring either biological uncertainty or
operational uncertainty may result in a suboptimal recommendation. This
framework presented can accommodate diverse data sources and modelling
approaches, and has wide applicability to guide invasive species
management and conservation efforts.</p>

<div
id="modelling-the-uncertainty-and-optimal-control-of-disease-outbreaks"
class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Modelling the uncertainty and optimal control of disease
outbreaks</strong></h1>
<p>we combine population models and value of information analysis
analyses to understand the uncertainties that are hindering decision
decision-making in disease outbreak management and to inform public
health policy. It is increasingly common that there are multiple
independent models that can contribute to policy development in research
fields including climate change and disease management. I developed a
framework for integrating model output to identify actions that are
robust to the parametric, structural, and other uncertainties reflected
in an ensemble of models in disease management, using Ebola management
as a case study. My study showed that the uncertainty that is of most
interest epidemiologically may not be the same as the uncertainty that
is most relevant for management. If the goal is to improve management
outcomes, then the focus of study should be to identify and resolve
those uncertainties that most hinder the choice of an optimal
intervention, which has been largely ignored in previous studies (Li et
al. 2017, PNAS).</p>
<p><img src="photos/pnas.jpg"
style="width:100.0%" /> Determining how best to manage an infectious
disease outbreak may be hindered by both epidemiological uncertainty in
disease processes and operational uncertainty about the effectiveness of
candidate interventions. We simultaneously addressed both sources of
uncertainty using an approach of Value of Information analysis, to
elucidate which source most impedes decision-making in the case of the
2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We found the selection of optimal
interventions was jointly determined by the underlying epidemiological
process, the effectiveness of the interventions and the size of the
budget. Under higher-budget conditions, resolution of epidemiological
uncertainty is most valuable. When budgets are tight, however,
operational and epidemiological uncertainty are equally important.
Overall, our study demonstrates that significant reductions in caseload
could result from a careful examination of both epidemiological and
operational uncertainties within the same modelling structure. This
approach can be applied to decision-making for the management of other
diseases or biological invasion for which multiple models and multiple
interventions are available (Li et al. 2021, Proc Biol Sci.).</p>
