My lab has established several permanent research platforms to conduct long-term ecological researches under climate change in the cold and dry regions in China.These research platforms provide an excellent opportunity for international collaborative projects.

We have established long-term seasonal warming experiments at two sites (3200m a.b.s and 4750m a.b.s) on Tibetan Plateau to examine the demographic responses of dominant alpine plants to climate warming.

We have established permanent study plots to monitor the population dynamics of dominant alpine plants along elevation gradients on Tibetan Plateau




Long-term precipitation platforms to study how plants in desertified sandland respond to changes in precipitation;
